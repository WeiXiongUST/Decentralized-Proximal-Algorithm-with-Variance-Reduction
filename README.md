# Decentralized-Proximal-Algorithm-with-Variance-Reduction
This repository contains the code used for the paper "PMGT-VR: A decentralized proximal-gradient algorithmic framework with variance reduction". The implementation is inspired by the work of Boyue Li (see https://github.com/liboyue/Network-Distributed-Algorithm) but is simplified. 

## Requirement 
- matplotlib
- networkx
- numpy
